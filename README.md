# FPH-Calculator
This is a project that I built for a friend of mine. It's just a fun project that I did for practice.
I did this practice project on 7th May.
So I was revising JavaScript and one of my friends called me and asked me to help him.
He was having a problem in his work where he had to manage more than 15/20+ customers in a short amount of time. So he was making mistakes in the total prices of the orders.

So, I told him to give me some time. I will build something that will help you to do the calculation and not only that I even wrote what he had to write as content to the customer depending on their total prices.
So this is the result.

By the way, the content is in English-Bengali mixed. So you might have problems understanding it.
